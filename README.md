# Next.js Single Page Test App

This is a single-page test application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), TypeScript, and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). The project was a test assignment where I broke down the components into manageable chunks to keep the code modular and maintainable.

## Features

- Single-page application using Next.js
- Styled with Tailwind CSS
- Written in TypeScript
- Component-based architecture for better maintainability

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
